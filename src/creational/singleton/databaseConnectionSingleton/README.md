# Database Connector Singleton

## Overview  
This guide demonstrates the design of a **thread-safe Singleton Database Connector** class in Java — a common exercise in Low-Level Design (LLD) interviews at companies like Amazon, Meta, and Google. The goal is to ensure only **one connection object** is created and shared across the system.

---

## 1. ✅ Understand Requirements & Constraints  
- Ensure only **one instance** of the `DatabaseConnector` exists throughout the application  
- Must be **thread-safe** in concurrent environments  
- Should provide a **global access point** to retrieve the connector  
- Can be extended later to simulate **real connection/query logic**  

---

## 2. 🔧 Design Singleton Structure  
- Declare a **private static volatile instance variable** `dbConnectorObj`  
- Use a **private constructor** to prevent instantiation from outside the class  
- Provide a **public static method `getInstance()`** to retrieve the single instance  

---

## 3. 🛡️ Implement Thread-Safe Singleton  
- Used **double-checked locking** within `synchronized` block  
- Applied `volatile` keyword to ensure memory consistency  
- Ensured **lazy initialization**, meaning the instance is only created when first accessed  

---

## 4. 🔍 Simulate Realistic Database Behavior *(Optional Expansion)*  
Though not implemented yet, you can later expand the class to support:
- `connect()` and `disconnect()` methods  
- `simulateQuery(String sql)` to mimic executing a query  
- `isConnected` flag to simulate state  
- Tracking number of connections or queries  

---

## 5. ✔️ Verify Singleton Property  
The `DatabaseConnectorTest` class:
- Calls `getInstance()` multiple times  
- Prints each object reference  
- Checks whether all references point to the **same instance** using `==`  
- Outputs **"Database Connection Object Created"** only once  

---

## 6. 🔒 Thread-Safety Validation  
- The double-checked locking pattern ensures only one instance is created even in multithreaded environments  
- Use of `volatile` ensures that partially constructed objects are not visible to other threads  
- Further testing with multithreading can validate its robustness  

---

## 7. 🚫 Prevent Runtime Modification *(Not required here but good to know)*  
- Avoid exposing internal implementation details  
- Prevent reflection or serialization attacks in advanced use cases  
- Make constructor defensive in future (e.g., throw error if already initialized)  

---

## 8. 🎯 Address Common Singleton Issues  

### ✅ Correct Implementation:
- `volatile` used for memory visibility  
- `synchronized` used for locking  
- `getInstance()` handles lazy initialization  
- Constructor is private  

### ⚠️ Pitfalls to Avoid (In Future):
- Creating public constructors  
- Forgetting `volatile` leading to subtle thread-safety bugs  
- Accessing mutable shared state without synchronization  

---

## 9. 🧪 Testing & Validation  
Basic validation done in `DatabaseConnectorTest`:
- Three instances retrieved — verified same reference  
- Printed object references and output message  
- Output proves **only one instance** is created  

Advanced testing ideas:
- Use multiple threads to access `getInstance()`  
- Simulate concurrent queries or operations  
- Add logs to detect race conditions  

---

## 🔑 Key Interview Points  

### ✅ Core Implementation Takeaways:
- Singleton instance is lazy-loaded and thread-safe  
- Uses `volatile` with double-checked locking  
- Demonstrates basic design principles clearly  

### 💡 Suggestions for Growth:
- Add mock query, connect, disconnect methods  
- Handle multi-threaded access simulations  
- Explore how Singleton can be broken (e.g., via reflection) and how to guard against that
